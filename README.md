# Tree-Dataset-Analysis
This project contains the analysis of a tree dataset collected on the University of Lincoln's Riseholme campus. The primary focus is to evaluate whether the Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) of a tree is influenced by the DBH of its nearest neighbouring tree within a 5-meter radius across four distinct woodland areas.
